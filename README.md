## Introduction

It is well known, that the single-objective spanning tree problem (MST) is solvable in polynomial time, e.g., by the Prim's algorithm. However, in real-world applications, e.g., in network design, often multiple conflicting objectives have to be considered simultaneously. The multi-criteria version of the MST is NP-hard. The **mcMST** package for the [R](https://www.r-project.org) programming language contains several methods for solving the multi-criteria spanning tree problem (mcMST).

Key features of the **mcMST** package are:

* A multi-objective version of Prim's algorithm.
* Evolutionary multi-objective algorithms (based on the Pr√ºfer-encoding or  direct edge list representation) with several mutation operators.
* A modular approach for benchmark problem generation (**outsourced to R package [grapherator](https://github.com/jakobbossek/grapherator)**.)

## Example

Here we first generate a bi-criteria graph problem with n = 25 nodes with [grapherator](https://github.com/jakobbossek/grapherator). The first objective is the Euclidean distance of node coordinates in the euclidean plane [0, 10] x [0, 10]. The second objective follows a normal distribution (N(5, 1.5)). 
```r
library(grapherator)
set.seed(1)
g = graph(lower = 0, upper = 100)
g = addNodes(g, n = 25, generator = addNodesUniform)
g = addEdges(g, generator = addEdgesDelauney)
g = addWeights(g, generator = addWeightsDistance, method = "euclidean")
g = addWeights(g, generator = addWeightsRandom, method = rnorm, mean = 5, sd = 1.5)
print(g)
```

Next, we apply the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm proposed by Bossek & Grimme with population size `mu = 10` and number of offspring `lambda = 10` for `max.iter = 100` generations.
```r
library(ggplot2)
res = mcMSTEmoaBG(g, mu = 30L, max.iter = 300L)
ecr::plotFront(res$pareto.front)
```
See the package vignettes for more details.
