\title{Add weights to a multi-objective graph.}
\usage{
addWeights(graph, method = "euclidean", weight.fun = NULL,
  symmetric = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{[\code{mcGP}]\cr
Multi-objective graph problem.}

\item{method}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr
Method used to generate weights. Possible values are \dQuote{euclidean}, \dQuote{maximum},
\dQuote{manhatten}, \dQuote{canberra}, \dQuote{binary}, \code{minkowski} or \code{random}.
The latter generates (random) weights utilizing \code{weight.fun}. The remaining
options are passed down to \code{\link[stats]{dist}}, i.e., weights are generated
as distances between the node coordinates.}

\item{weight.fun}{[\code{function(m, ...) | NULL}]\cr
Function used to generate weights. The first arument needs to be number of weights
to generate.}

\item{symmetric}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
Should the weights be symmetric, i.e., w(i, j) = w(j, i) for each pair i, j of nodes?
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{...}{[any]\cr
Additional arguments passed down to \code{weight.fun} or \code{\link[stats]{dist}}. See
documentation of argument \code{method} for details.}

\description{
\code{addWeights} allows to generate edge weights for a multi-objective
graph instance. The weights can be generated on basis of the node coordinates (in this
case \code{\link[stats]{dist}} is applied with the cooresponding \code{method}).
Alternatively, all kinds of random weights can be generated.
